# DoubleT x AndyABG Panel Clip Configurator
![Configurator](Images/Configurator.png)
## About
Its a panel clip generator that matches the Tiny-T Rev.2 design.
## Why
I decided to create a Configurator for two reaseons:
- I wanted to use diffrent foam thickness than the original spec and was tired of making a new model every time i wanted to use a diffrent panel/ foam tape combo.
- No midspan clip was ever designed and I wanted to design one to match the same style as the corner clips.
## Instructions
- Simply Download the [.f3d file](/Universal%20Mods/2020/DoubleT%20x%20AndyABG%20Panel%20Clip%20Configurator/CAD/DoubleT%20x%20AndyABG%20panel%20clip%20configurator%20v8.f3d)
- Open the Change parameters window in the Modify Menu
- Change the parameters to match the pannel thickness and foamtape thickness you intend to use
- Save each Clip as a mesh and then print
